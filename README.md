# roadmapping
roadmapping for the play project

# goal
The issues of this repository are only concerned with an overview and supposed to link to the issues of other repos which contain more details. In the long term, the github page of this repository is supposed to offer p2p based tooling to support the roadmapping process.
The tooling will "pull in" data about issues from other repository to provide an overview.
